<h1>The Best Movies According to Ashish</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>I love the way how the protagonist manages to convince people with valid facts not just random suppositions</p>
<h3>Gintama</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime. Stick with it for the first 30 episodes and you'll fall in love</p>
<h3>John Wick 4</h3>
<p>Slick action and no uneccessary dialogues. A little boys dream come true.</p>
